  * Medical Terminology: An Accelerated Approach approaches medical terminology not as words to be memorized but as a language to be learned and teaches students to break down words into their composite word parts. Instead of a dictionary full of terms that need to be memorized, a student equipped with groups of roots, prefixes, and suffixes can easily understand a vast amount of medical terminology regardless of how long or short their med term course is. Medical Terminology: An Accelerated Approach bridges the gap between the two fields that make up medical terminology―medicine and second-language acquisition. It provided assistance in language skills to equip health care professionals to use and understand medical terminology and gives them real-world examples that make their knowledge applicable to working in the world of health care.
